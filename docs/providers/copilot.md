# GitHub Copilot

Tracks GitHub Copilot usage quotas for both paid and free tier users.

## Authentication

The plugin looks for a GitHub token in this order:

1. **UsagePal Keychain** (`UsagePal-copilot`) — Token previously cached by the plugin
2. **GitHub CLI Keychain** (`gh:github.com`) — Token from `gh auth login`
3. **State File** (`auth.json`) — Fallback file-based storage

### Setup

Install and authenticate with the GitHub CLI:

```bash
# Install gh CLI (macOS)
brew install gh

# Authenticate
gh auth login
```

Choose "GitHub.com" and follow the prompts. The plugin will automatically read the token from the gh CLI keychain.

Once authenticated via gh CLI, the plugin caches the token in the UsagePal keychain for faster access on subsequent probes.

## API

**Endpoint:** `https://api.github.com/copilot_internal/user`

**Headers:**
```
Authorization: token <token>
Accept: application/json
Editor-Version: vscode/1.96.2
Editor-Plugin-Version: copilot-chat/0.26.7
User-Agent: GitHubCopilotChat/0.26.7
X-Github-Api-Version: 2025-04-01
```

### Response (Paid Tier)

```json
{
  "copilot_plan": "pro",
  "quota_reset_date": "2025-02-15T00:00:00Z",
  "quota_snapshots": {
    "premium_interactions": {
      "percent_remaining": 80,
      "entitlement": 300,
      "remaining": 240,
      "overage_permitted": true,
      "overage_count": 12,
      "quota_id": "premium"
    },
    "chat": {
      "unlimited": true,
      "entitlement": -1,
      "remaining": -1
    }
  }
}
```

Since usage-based billing (AI Credits), the `premium_interactions` pool is shown as **Credits**
(percent used). When `percent_remaining` is absent it is derived from `remaining / entitlement`. A
bucket that is `unlimited`, carries the `-1` entitlement/remaining sentinel, or has a `0` entitlement
is suppressed rather than rendered as a misleading 0%. When `overage_permitted` is true, premium usage
beyond the pool is surfaced as an **Extra Usage** count (`overage_count`).

### Response (Free Tier)

```json
{
  "copilot_plan": "individual",
  "access_type_sku": "free_limited_copilot",
  "limited_user_quotas": {
    "chat": 410,
    "completions": 4000
  },
  "monthly_quotas": {
    "chat": 500,
    "completions": 4000
  },
  "limited_user_reset_date": "2025-02-11"
}
```
